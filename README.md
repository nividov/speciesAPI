# speciesINFO

This Website provides you with information for any species. You simply have to search for the sceintific name of your species, and all die information will be shown to you.

## Information to the tasks
- P2 Usability

to deliver a better user experience, i followed design patterns throughout the application

- P3 Datentrennung

In this application, the data handling is performed in separate module, so that all the GUI components don't have to worry about fetching or modifying data, but only display the information its gives. 

- P4 persistente Datenhaltung (API)

I chose to built this application in a way, that every new search triggers a request to the API. Therefore, the data is persistent and always in sync with the data on the server.
